# Get your API Keys

1. To get weather data we need to use API to fetch data & for that i have used Open Weather Map API. Its free to use & highly accurate data.

2. To get your keys, simply sign up into Open Weather & then confirm your email account & after this you will get Your API key. Your API Key will be sent to to mail & also you can find your key into dashboard in the same website.

3. Now, finally you got your API Key then include that key in src/config/dev for development and src/config/prod for production.
